# keyword_explicit
Understanding of ***explicit*** keyword behaviour in cpp prog.

In general if a class has a constructor which can be called with a single argument, then this constructor becomes conversion constructor because such a constructor allows conversion of the single argument to the class being constructed.

We can make the constructor explicit(doesn't allow implicit conversions) with the help of ***explicit*** keyword.
